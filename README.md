# Genapi
Generates an typescript API extension script from Spring Boot Annotation based config

## Not really tested code

As you can see there are no unit tests or anything included in this project (yet, ofc)
I have not either tested the typescript file generated from the example.

So obviously this is a work in progress!

## Feel free to contribute

If you have any great ideas, please fork and create a pull request. Or create an issue.

## Maven Central?

Well.. Since the code is yet to be tested (at all) there is no plans for deploying anything to the maven central yet.

## How do I use this?

Check out the module genapi-example to see how it is used. Download the code and run ```gradle build``` and you should see a ```apiConfig.ts``` file generated in the class_path.
